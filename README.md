## Reflections

1.0 completed 17/7/2020.

Produces the correct output but doesn't feel like a good solution. Feel it performs poorly on both time and space complexity.

Might be ok in present state if it could be reworked into a queue instead of an enormous array.

On the bright side it works after getting blocked on it for a while. Leave aside, practice up on graphs, algorithms, data structures etc and come back to it (or a similar problem) after a bit of a rest.
